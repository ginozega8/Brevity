The idea is basically a small social network that consists of posts of quotes placed on cards that contain different data and can be organized in different ways. Also, the user could create his own quote cards with a small form. To achieve this, I used Express to develop a REST API in my backend to then access the data from React with Axios to handle HTTPS requests, in this case, I worked with PUT, GET and POST requests.
